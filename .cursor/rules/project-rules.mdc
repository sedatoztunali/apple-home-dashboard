Rule: Localization completeness
Description: If we implement or change any localization-related feature (new keys, renamed keys, or behavior depending on translations), ensure corresponding keys are added/updated across ALL language files under `src/translations` (including `en` as canonical and every supported locale), keeping key structures consistent.
Rule: Complete TODO implementation
Description: If a task is defined in `TODO.md`, implement all code changes and required configuration end-to-end to satisfy its acceptance criteria. Do not leave partial work; ensure builds/lints pass and behavior is verified before marking it complete. After completing a TODO item, mark it as complete in `TODO.md` and move it to the "Tamamlananlar" (Completed) section with the completion date.
Rule: Test deployment workflow
Description: When the user requests to "send for testing" or equivalent, perform the following steps in order: 1) Increment the version number in `package.json`, 2) Run the build process (e.g., `npm run build` or `webpack`), 3) Check for build/lint errors, 4) If no errors, commit all changes with an appropriate commit message, 5) Push to the main branch. Never skip version bumping before pushing test deployments.
